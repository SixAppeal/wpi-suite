Main Body View: 

Working: 
	Making a task works - needs to be adapted for the real task and not the test task that was implemented
	Making a task Pane works - needs work; see below
		(task Pane is what holds tasks)
	
Needs Improvement: 
	The allignment of the task Panes is crude. It is a flow layout so the location of the top of the panes is hard to contorol
		- Tried using a box layout for this instead, the problem was that java kept placing a box to the left of the panes that coudldnt get to go away
		- Tried using grid, couldnt figure it out
		- Tried playing with different allignment schemes (intermixing two layouts) and just got weird results
	Need to implement the controller in the buttons, doing this would allow the buttons to actually respond to the constructor of task panes etc. 
		- UI has methods (for most part, could be missing one or two) to build the propor panes etc if given the command from controler. 
		
	
Future:
	Currently, none of the implementations include a scroll bar. A scroll bar was attempted, and is NOT HARD to implement but hard to control. 
	The discussed problem of the random box that was appearing was what occured when the scroll bar was implemented. Problems may be related? 
	Unsure.
